    Math object :
        Math.floor() : Removes the decimal value from a number
                Ex : Math.floor(4.9) returns 4
        Math.random() : this generates random number in decimals
            Ex : 0.3986657921909309
            
    Dom manipulation :
        document.querySelector() : used to select an HTML element using css class name like below
            Ex : document.querySelector('#current-0').textContent = 'Text value';
            * '#current-0' is CSS class name
            * textContent will be used to select the text in the html element
            
            Ex : document.querySelector('#current-0').innerHTMl = = '<em>' + dice + '</em>';
            
            * innerHTML is used to set HTML value.
            * we can get the value from an element and store it in an variable like below
                Ex : var x = document.querySelector('#score-0').textContent;
                
            * CSS class name can be generated dynamically like bellow
                var actvePlayer = 0;
                var x = document.querySelector('#score-' + actvePlayer).textContent;
                * where '#score-' + actvePlayer =  '#score-0'
                
            * Manuplate the CSS style using DOM
                Ex : document.querySelector('.dice').style.display = 'none';
                    * Using the .dice CSS class name get the element and get the syle method using .style and change the display property by .display set to 'none'
            document.getElementById() :
                * Can be used to select and HTML element which has an id
                * this is faster than document.querySelector()
                    
    Events and Events handling :
                    
        Events :
            * Notification that are sent to notify the code that something happened on the webpage.
            Ex : Clicking a button, resizing a window, scrolling down or pressing a key.

        Event Listner :
            * A function that performs an action based on a certain event. 
            * It waits for a specific event to happen.

        How the events are processed :
            * Events are executed only after execution stck is empty
            * That means all the functions are returned then even will be executed    
            * ES will have something called Message Queue.

        Message Queue : 
            * All the events are put here by JS engine
            * these are waiting until ES gets empty to be executed
            * Event listner function gets it's own executio context in ES and the first event in the Message Queve will be executed
            
    How to set up an event handler
        * Best way to set up event handler is to define a Anonymus function
        Ex :
            document.querySelector('.btn-roll').addEventListener('click', function() {
                //Do something here
            });
    
    Callback function
        * A function that is passed to another function as an argument and this function will call the passed function for us.
            Ex : 
                function btn() {
                    //do something here
                }
                document.querySelector('.btn-roll').addEventListener('click', btn);
    
    anonymous function
        * Function that does not have a name and that can not be re-used
            Ex :
                document.querySelector('.btn-roll').addEventListener('click', function() {
                    //Do something here
                });
    
    
    != performs type cohersion
    !== does not performs type cohersion
                
    What the ternary operator is
        * use ternary oprators instaed of if condition
             activePlayer === 0 ? activePlayer = 1 : activePlayer = 0;
    
    How to add, remove and toggle HTML classes.
        * Remove the style form the class
            document.querySelector('.player-0-panel').classList.remove('active');
        * Add the style to the class
            document.querySelector('.player-1-panel').classList.add('active');
        * Toggle style in between two classes
            document.querySelector('.player-0-panel').classList.toggle('active');
            document.querySelector('.player-1-panel').classList.toggle('active');
            
            
    How to use functions to correctly apply DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
        * Use functions for code which are being repeated
